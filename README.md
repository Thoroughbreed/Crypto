# CryptoVault

### What is this?
A quite simple but very effective application to create encrypted messages (and decrypt them) together with a strong AES encrypted password vault/manager

The application is fairly straightforward and can en-/decrypt messages without logging in.
When you launch the application you will be presented with a menu
- Encrypt
- Decrypt
- Log in

When you select log in you'll need to use the master password (which is stored as a SHA256 hash in the application itself)

### Changelog
| Version | Change |
|-|-|
| 0.0.5 | First release, en-/decrypts messages |
| 0.1.0 | Added simple menu |
| 0.1.1Â | Added login to password vault |
| 0.2.0 | Added secondary "master password" for decryption |

### Roadmap
- [x] Make a fully functional encryption service
- [x] Decrypt text using a key and cipher from other source (AES)
- [x] Make it easily expandable (prepare for web frontend etc.)
- [x] Create a password vault with secure login
- [x] Separate login password and the master password/key (Currently you *can* reverse engineer and decrypt it if you look at the src
- [ ] Add function to generate a random (secure-ish) password and add it to vault
- [ ] Make a non-console UI
- [ ] Enable encryption of files (not only text)
- [ ] Enable "Admin-mode" and the possibility of multiple users (with their own master-key and vault)
- [ ] Kill all bugs ;)
