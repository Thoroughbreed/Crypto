# SerialLogger

### What is this?
A quite simple but very effective application to create encrypted messages (and decrypt them) together with a strong AES encrypted password vault/manager

The application is fairly straightforward and can en-/decrypt messages without logging in.
When you launch the application you will be presented with a menu
- Encrypt
- Decrypt
- Log in

When you select log in you'll need to use the master password (which is stored as a SHA256 hash in the application itself)
